## Getting your foot in

Our preferred way of providing the opportunity for people to contribute to Noodle is through a process that starts with creating a new issue, the summary of the workflow that you can expect and should adhere to is the following:

- You see an area of improvement in the code base, this could be a fix, feature, refactoring...etc
- Create an [issue](https://github.com/noodle-run/noodle/issues) on our Github repository.
- Wait until a team member discusses the issue with you, and if both parties are in agreement, you can start working on the issue.
- Once work has started, you can create a draft pull request and remember to link your pull request with the issue.
- Once the work is complete, change the status of the pull request to ready for review.
- We will review the pull request and if all is good, congratulations! ðŸ¥³ you are now a Noodle contributor!
- If not, we will explain the changes that need to be made for the pull request to be merged or why it can't be merged.

If you would like to be more involved in the development of Noodle, we would like to invite you to our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/SERySfj8Eg) where we can have a chat together and get you involved in the project!

### Some simple rules

- Don't work on an issue that is already being worked on by someone else.
- Don't work on something without getting a team member's approval, this is to not waste your time by making you work on something that won't be merged.
- Don't demand for your pull request to be approved and merged.
- Be nice to everyone involved, we are aiming to create a positive community around collaborating and contributing towards Noodle's development.

There are a lot of other technologies being used in this project, however these are the most important and influential bits of it.

## Getting stuff running

### Cloning the repo

To clone the repo, you firstly need to [fork](https://github.com/noodle-run/noodle/fork) it, and then clone your copy of noodle locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-gh-username>/noodle.git
```

### Bun

Bun is used as the package manager of Noodle, with Bun, you don't need to have NodeJS installed at all on your system to be able to run Noodle. The only tool you need to install dependencies & run Noodle is Bun!

To install bun, head over to [their website](https://bun.sh/) which will tell you how to get it installed on your system.

To check that you have Bun installed, simply run the following command:

```bash
bun --version
```

If this commands outputs a version number, you're all good to go.

### Installing dependencies

With bun installed on your machine, the next step would be to install the dependencies that Noodle relies upon to work, to do this, run the following command:

```bash
bun install
```

### Environment Variables

Now that Bun & dependencies has been installed, it's time to configure your environment variables so that the project works as expected:

1.  Duplicate the `.env.example` file as just `.env`
2.  Populate the values with your own, you will need to sign up to some services in the process.

You can checkout which variables are needed and which are optional in the `src/env.ts` file.

### Running stuff

```bash
# Run the project's dev server
bun dev

# Build the project
bun run build

# Run the built project in production mode
bun start

# Run the typecheck script
bun typecheck

# Lint using ESLint
bun lint

# Format using Prettier
bun format
```
