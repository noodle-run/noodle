![Noodle Preview](https://github.com/noodle-run/noodle/blob/main/public/preview.png?raw=true)

<p align="center" style="color:dodgerblue;"><strong>⚠️ This is a UI design mockup of what the platform will look like, it is not the current state of the project.</strong></p>

## Purpose

Noodle as an idea came from the struggles that I faced during my university years. I was using multiple apps to try and stay on track with my studies, and I thought to myself, why is there no singular app that can do everything a student needs to stay on track with their studies? Like a GitHub but for students.
